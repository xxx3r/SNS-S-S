Q1 2026 Experiment Plan
=======================

Primary scenario: Asteroid Scout
--------------------------------

We simulate a small swarm of SNS-like units orbiting a single
asteroid-like body.

Simplified world model:

* 2D angular coordinate theta ∈ [0, 2π) for position.
* The asteroid rotates at angular rate omega_body.
* The Sun is fixed in world coordinates.
* Each SNS agent sits on a ring just above the asteroid and experiences
  periodic day/night cycles as the asteroid rotates.

Illumination:

* When a given theta is on the "day" side, the local solar flux is
  F_sun ≈ 1360 W/m^2 (or reduced by a configurable factor).
* When on the "night" side, F_sun = 0.
* Optionally include a cos(incidence) factor later.

SNS agent model
---------------

Each agent maintains:

* theta : angular position on the orbit (scalar, radians).
* A_eff : effective illuminated PV area (0 → A_PV).
* E : stored energy (Wh or arbitrary units).
* mode : one of {HARVEST, IDLE, COMM_BEAM, MOVE}.

Key parameters (per agent or shared):

* A_PV : solar collection area (0.1 – 1.0 m^2).
* eta_PV : PV efficiency (0.2 – 0.3).
* E_max : storage capacity (e.g., 0.5 – 5 Wh).
* P_idle, P_comm, P_move : housekeeping, comm, and maneuver power.
* eta_beam : beaming efficiency (0–1).
* E_beam_min : minimum stored energy before beaming is allowed.

Power-chain dynamics per timestep Δt:

1. Solar power harvested:
   P_sun_i = Flux_sun_i * A_eff_i * eta_PV

2. Load power consumption P_load_i depends on mode.

3. Storage update:
   E_i(t+Δt) = clamp(E_i(t) + (P_sun_i - P_load_i) * Δt, 0, E_max)

4. If mode == COMM_BEAM and E_i > E_beam_min,
   energy is transferred to the host (and optionally other SNS agents)
   with efficiency eta_beam.

Swarm- and host-level metrics
-----------------------------

We want to track at least:

* E_host_total : total energy delivered to the host.
* E_total_harvested : total solar energy harvested by the swarm.
* Distribution of E_i at end of run (mean, variance, percent of "dead"
  agents with E ≈ 0).
* Coverage metrics: how well the swarm spreads around the asteroid.
* Agent "mortality": how many agents have depleted batteries at any
  given time.

Planned experiments
-------------------

1. Baseline vs coordinated:
   * Baseline: agents only try to keep themselves alive; no beaming.
   * Coordinated: agents decide to beam energy when above a threshold
     and the host needs power.

2. Beaming efficiency sweep:
   * Sweep eta_beam over a range (e.g., 0.1–0.9) and examine when beaming
     becomes beneficial versus wasteful.

3. PV area / swarm size tradeoff:
   * For fixed total PV area, compare "few large" vs "many small" SNS
     configurations.

The goal is to generate plots and tables that show how even very simple
coordination can change the effective usefulness of a swarm, without
overcomplicating the physics in this first iteration.
