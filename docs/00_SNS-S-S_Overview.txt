SNS-S-S :: Solar-Nano-Sphere Simulation
=======================================

Purpose
-------

This repository hosts a small but extensible Python simulation framework
for exploring Solar-Nano-Sphere (SNS) swarms as future space-based solar
power infrastructure.

The Q1 2026 objective is **not** to build a perfect physical model but a
clean "toy universe" where we can:

1. Represent simple orbital environments (starting with an asteroid belt
   scout scenario).
2. Populate them with SNS-like agents that harvest sunlight, store
   energy, and choose when to beam energy to a host.
3. Compare naive / uncoordinated behavior to simple coordinated swarm
   policies.
4. Generate plots + metrics that can feed into future whitepapers,
   funding decks, and more realistic simulations.

Design principles
-----------------

* Keep the codebase **small, legible, and testable**.
* Prefer explicit, documented parameters over "magic numbers."
* Make it easy to:
  - plug in new environments (e.g., GEO ring segment),
  - modify agent control rules,
  - and run param sweeps as standalone scripts or notebooks.
* Treat this repo as the **public, educational face** of the SNS concept.
