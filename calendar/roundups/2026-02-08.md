# SNS Weekly Roundup

Sunday, Feb 8, 2026 (week ending 2026-02-08)

This week didn’t deliver a single “unlock everything” miracle, but it did tighten the toolchain in two places that matter for SNS: laser power relays (near-term demos) and distributed beamforming math (swarm-scale steering).

⸻

1) PV & Materials for Space

A) Space-oriented perovskite tandems are still “program mode,” not “product mode”
	•	Japan: perovskite/CIGS tandem for the space environment (project selection)
• Summary: A reported project selection focused on perovskite/CIGS tandem cells explicitly framed for space environment requirements.
• Why it matters for SNS: This is exactly the “thin, light, scalable PV layer” direction your min-mass philosophy wants, even if today it’s still R&D.

2) Metasurfaces & Nonlinear Photonics

A) Deep learning is becoming a standard wrench for metasurface / metamaterial design
	•	Review: DL for metamaterial/metasurface antenna design (2025)
• Summary: Surveys deep-learning workflows that speed up EM structure design (forward models + inverse design), especially relevant to antennas and wave control.
• Why it matters for SNS: Your “photonic neural control layer” is basically this idea, but embedded and power-starved. This review is a map of the current playbook (and its limits).
• Tags: [META][CTRL][MFG]

B) Programmable metasurfaces remain credible for beam steering, but you should treat them as a control surface, not an “energy amplifier”
	•	Programmable metasurface beam steering (review)
• Summary: Overviews how programmable metasurfaces steer and shape beams via controlled phase/amplitude patterns.
• Why it matters for SNS: They can redirect / focus energy, not create more of it. Your “relay chain” wins by minimizing loss + maintaining coherence + smart pointing, not by magically adding Joules.

3) Storage & Ultra-Low-Power Electronics

A) Solid-state battery interfaces are still moving (the “crack problem” is getting real attention)
	•	All-solid-state battery advance (PSI / press release)
• Summary: Describes a coating/interface approach aimed at enabling compact, durable solid-state batteries.
• Why it matters for SNS: Storage is your “night side survival organ.” Any credible path toward durable thin solid-state storage helps the tile/sail roadmap and eventually the nano-regime.

4) SBSP & Power Beaming

A) DARPA’s POWER program is the clearest “serious money + serious demos” signal
	•	DARPA POWER program (official)
• Summary: Program framing for optical wireless power relay (multi-node relays), explicitly aligned with long-distance power beaming concepts.
• Why it matters for SNS: SNS can piggyback conceptually: relay logic, pointing, safety constraints, atmospheric/space link thinking.
• Tags: [SBSP][CTRL][SWARM]  ￼
	•	Reported milestone: ~800 W over ~5.3 miles (distance/power record context)
• Summary: Secondary reporting describing a notable transfer demo scale.
• Why it matters for SNS: Not “Sun→Earth,” but it’s a real rung on the ladder for power-through-air and relay architectures.
• Tags: [SBSP]  ￼

B) Airborne receiver demos keep showing up
	•	Overview Energy: airborne laser power receiver announcement
• Summary: Press-release style claim of airborne receiving of laser power.
• Why it matters for SNS: Even if marketing-heavy, it reinforces the trend: power beaming is leaving pure-lab territory and becoming demo-able systems engineering.
• Tags: [SBSP][CTRL]  ￼

5) Swarm Robotics & Distributed Space Systems

A) Swarm flight heritage is accumulating (quietly)
	•	NASA Starling mission (AMOSTech paper)
• Summary: Documents an on-orbit autonomous formation-flying / swarm-style demo mission architecture.
• Why it matters for SNS: SNS relays need “swarm discipline” under comms + power constraints. Starling-type work is the closest real analogue to your coordination layer.
• Tags: [SWARM][CTRL]

B) The math for distributed beamforming is actively being sharpened
	•	Multi-satellite beamforming under position uncertainty (arXiv)
• Summary: Tackles beamforming when satellite positions aren’t perfect, quantifying performance under uncertainty.
• Why it matters for SNS: This is basically “how to keep the beam coherent when reality jitters.” That’s the swarm-beaming headache.
• Tags: [SWARM][SBSP][CTRL]  ￼

⸻

A) Weighted Belief Shift (week ending Feb 8)
	•	Up: [SBSP] power-beaming demos (more programs + more prototype energy).  ￼
	•	Up: [SWARM] distributed pointing/beamforming theory (uncertainty-aware methods are maturing).  ￼
	•	Slight up: [STOR] solid-state interface progress (still early, but directionally good).  ￼
	•	Steady: [PV] space perovskite (signals of intent, still not “space-proven commodity”).

B) Suggested Actions (turn these into repo “quests”)
	1.	QST-SBSP-0001: Add a “Relay Chain Reality Check” note: focus on loss minimization + coherence + pointing, not energy multiplication. (Tie to metasurface + beamforming items.)  ￼
	2.	QST-CTRL-0002: Build a toy sim: N-node relay with pointing error, track end-to-end received power vs jitter. (Seed with the beamforming-under-uncertainty paper.)  ￼
	3.	QST-SBSP-0003: Add a DARPA POWER “requirements crib sheet” to SNS docs: relay safety, pointing, link budgeting, demo metrics.  ￼
	4.	QST-SWARM-0004: Extract Starling-like constraints into SNS swarm assumptions: comm windows, autonomy level, fault handling.
	5.	QST-META-0005: Create a “DL metasurface design pipeline” reading list and decide what’s “bench-feasible” in 2026 (simulation-first).
	6.	QST-STOR-0006: Write a one-page “night-side energy budget” target and map which storage tech paths could plausibly hit it.  ￼

C) SNS Awareness Update (what to keep in your head all week)
	•	The shortest path to “SNS becomes real” is still tile/sail prototypes that demonstrate: harvest → minimal buffering → beam/relay, plus swarm pointing. This week’s evidence mostly strengthens beaming + coordination, not PV miracles.  ￼
	•	Treat metasurfaces as steering optics and impedance-matching/control layers. They’re a “lens with knobs,” not a free-energy machine.
