# SNS Weekly Roundup

This week’s signal is strongest on power-beaming practicality (more “systems” than hype) and low-power autonomy hardware/software that can realistically live on energy-starved nodes.

⸻

PV & Materials for Space
	•	Perovskite solar cells for Low Earth Orbit space applications (2026, Energy Materials / OAEPublish)
• Summary: A current overview focused on why PSCs are attractive for LEO (power-to-weight, flexibility) and what still breaks them (stability, degradation modes).
• Why it matters for SNS: This is a clean “state of constraints” map for your [PV]+[MAT] assumptions, especially if SNS starts with larger thin PV tiles before shrinking to nano-scale.
• Tags: [PV][MAT]  ￼
	•	Ricoh perovskite solar cells installed on JAXA HTV‑X “Space Solar Cell Demonstration System (SDX)” (Oct 2025, company release)
• Summary: Ricoh reports an in-orbit demonstration path via SDX on HTV‑X1 after launch.
• Why it matters for SNS: Whatever the details, this is the direction you want: real space exposure data for thin perovskites (radiation/thermal/vacuum cycling). Use it to de-risk your early PV layer choices.
• Tags: [PV][MAT][MFG]  ￼
	•	ROSA deployable array lineage remains a credible “bridge tech” (NASA impact story)
• Summary: NASA continues to frame Roll‑Out Solar Arrays as compact, scalable, multi-mission deployables.
• Why it matters for SNS: If SNS needs a near-term “macro scaffold” phase, ROSA-like deployables are a real reference point for packaging, deployment dynamics, and power/mass trade closures.

Metasurfaces & Nonlinear Photonics
	•	Stacked Intelligent Metasurface (SIM) architectures doing analog beamforming “in the wave domain” (Jan 2026, arXiv:2503.00368v4)
• Summary: Proposes layered programmable metasurfaces that form parallel subchannels and mitigate interference/fading in wideband systems.
• Why it matters for SNS: It’s comms-motivated, but the architectural idea generalizes: stacked programmable layers as a controllable propagation medium—useful for your relay-node “steer/shape with minimal compute” concept.
• Tags: [META][CTRL]  ￼
	•	STAR‑RIS angle estimation under practical metasurface configurations (Feb 2026, arXiv:2602.02893)
• Summary: Builds a full-space angle estimation framework and bounds for STAR‑RIS under uniform/non-uniform energy-splitting setups.
• Why it matters for SNS: SNS lives or dies on pointing + state estimation under constraints. Even if the application is RF, the math is relevant to “where is the beam / where is the neighbor node?” with imperfect sensing.
• Tags: [META][CTRL][SWARM]  ￼
	•	Fourier neural operator approach for metasurface channel estimation (late Jan 2026, arXiv:2508.00268)
• Summary: Uses operator-learning (FNO/H-FNO) to map metasurface shapes to channel responses efficiently.
• Why it matters for SNS: This supports your “inverse design / learned control surface” workflow: fast surrogate models that could run on the ground (design-time) while the swarm executes lightweight control policies.

Storage & Ultra‑Low‑Power Electronics
	•	Power management unit with continuous MPPT + parallel regulation/storing stages (Feb 2026, arXiv:2602.02376)
• Summary: PMU architecture aimed at reducing cascading losses and improving MPPT/regulation for energy-harvesting sources; includes adaptive ratio control and high-voltage charging stage.
• Why it matters for SNS: This is the kind of work that turns “nano energy budgets” from fantasy to engineering—especially if early SNS nodes are energy-harvesting constrained and need ruthless conversion efficiency.
• Tags: [CTRL][STOR]  ￼
	•	Radiation-hardened low-power SRAM cell design (2025, Applied Sciences/MDPI)
• Summary: Proposes a multi-transistor SRAM cell aiming to reduce soft-error vulnerability (SEU/SEMNUs).
• Why it matters for SNS: If you assume COTS memory + shielding, you’ll carry mass and risk. Rad-hard memory primitives (even incremental) move you toward lighter autonomy stacks.
• Tags: [CTRL][MAT]  ￼
	•	NASA TechPort: neuromorphic processor with radiation-tolerant MRAM (Jan 2026, project listing)
• Summary: NASA-backed project framing neuromorphic compute + rad-tolerant memory for space autonomy.
• Why it matters for SNS: This aligns with your “do more cognition per joule” need for swarm coordination and beam control—especially when comms are sparse and decisions must be local.
• Tags: [CTRL][MAT]  ￼

SBSP & Power Beaming
	•	DARPA POWER program remains the sharpest “energy web” signal (official program page)
• Summary: POWER aims at airborne optical energy relays to enable resilient, multi-path energy transport.
• Why it matters for SNS: SNS is basically “space version of an energy web.” POWER is a near-term proxy for relay-network performance metrics, safety constraints, and demo milestones.
• Tags: [SBSP][CTRL][SWARM]  ￼
	•	Optical power beaming record context stays a meaningful rung (2025 coverage, Photonics/IEEE Spectrum)
• Summary: Reports POWER test results in the “hundreds of watts over kilometer-scale” regime, with energy totals and campaign outcomes described.
• Why it matters for SNS: Even if not new this week, it anchors what actually closes today: apertures, tracking, conversion, and thermal management—your relay-node design must respect these realities.
• Tags: [SBSP]  ￼
	•	PowerLight laser power-beaming system moving toward integrated flight tests (Dec 2025–Feb 2026, company + coverage)
• Summary: PowerLight describes completed subsystem validation and plans for integrated flight testing in early 2026; multiple outlets highlight “in-flight charging” demonstrations and tracking to altitude.
• Why it matters for SNS: Treat it as a “terrestrial cousin” of SNS: tracking + safety + conversion under motion. Useful for relay control loops and failure modes, even if the performance claims need independent verification.
• Tags: [SBSP][CTRL]  ￼

Swarm Robotics & Distributed Space Systems
	•	NASA Starling mission: distributed spacecraft autonomy as an operational platform (NASA overview pages)
• Summary: Starling continues to be NASA’s on-orbit testbed for swarm/distributed autonomy tech (coordination without constant ground control).
• Why it matters for SNS: Starling is closest-to-home evidence that multi-agent coordination in space is real and improving; use its constraints to keep your SNS swarm assumptions honest (comms limits, autonomy level, fault handling).

Weighted Belief Shift
	•	Up: [SBSP] near-term feasibility of relay-style power networks (more program maturity + integrated demos).  ￼
	•	Up: [CTRL] “energy-autonomy stack” credibility (PMU/MPPT + rad-tolerant memory direction).  ￼
	•	Steady (but clarifying): [PV][MAT] perovskites-for-LEO remains promising, but the constraint map is still the story (stability + environment).  ￼
	•	Up (tools, not miracles): [META] metasurface control/estimation methods that can feed your “low-compute steering” playbook.  ￼

Suggested Actions
	1.	Update SNS_v0.1 “Energy Web” chapter: adopt DARPA POWER framing (multi-path relay metrics + safety envelopes) as your near-term requirements scaffold.  ￼
	2.	Add a “PMU baseline” to node budgets: model harvest→MPPT→store/regulate losses using the Feb 2026 PMU architecture as a reference design target.  ￼
	3.	Swarm realism pass: codify Starling-derived autonomy constraints (what’s plausible without continuous ground support).  ￼
	4.	PV risk register refresh: fold the LEO perovskite constraint taxonomy into your PV/material gates (what must be proven before scaling).  ￼
	5.	Metasurface “learned surrogate” workflow: treat FNO/operator-learning as your design-time accelerator, not an on-node runtime dependency.  ￼
