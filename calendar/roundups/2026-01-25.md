# Weekly SNS Breakthrough Roundup
week_of: 2026-01-25

## Highlights
January’s strongest signal was metasurface control + uncertainty-aware design shifting toward deployable engineering. SBSP beaming demos (moving-target tracking) improved confidence in beamforming control. Energy-aware swarm scheduling kept professionalizing, while PV/storage/control trends remained steady.

## By Lens
- PV & Materials: incremental progress; AI-driven reliability/manufacturing optimization continues.
- Metasurfaces: control frameworks + uncertainty-aware design gaining traction.
- Storage & Control: energy-harvesting interfaces trending toward ultra-low-power integration.
- SBSP & Beaming: moving-target tracking demos strengthen operational confidence.
- Swarms: resource-aware autonomy is increasingly practical.

## A) Weighted Belief Shift (-2..+2)
META: +1.5
SBSP: +1.0
SWARM: +1.0
CTRL: +0.5
PV: +0.5
STOR: +0.2

## B) Suggested Actions (Quests)
- QST-0101 Metasurface Control Stack (Network Perspective)
- QST-0102 UQ Harness for Inverse-Designed Photonics
- QST-0103 Q1 2026 Power-Chain Sim v0
- QST-0104 Beam Tracking Abstraction
- QST-0105 Energy-Aware Swarm Policy

## C) SNS Awareness Update
Physics-limited near-sun constraints remain dominant; engineering validation is improving; funding remains a gating factor for interplanetary beaming.
