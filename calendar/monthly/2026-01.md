# January 2026 Monthly Overview

## Summary
January strengthened the case that metasurfaces are moving from lab curiosities into engineerable systems, while SBSP beaming demos and energy-aware swarm scheduling signaled steady applied progress. PV and storage/control continued incremental gains without a single breakout. The overarching takeaway: "intelligent beam-shaping skins + swarm control" feels closer to engineering than alchemy, while near-sun thermal/radiation and funding constraints remain the dominant bottlenecks.

## Key Deltas (from Dec 2025)
- Metasurfaces: control + uncertainty-aware design moved the needle most.
- SBSP: moving-target tracking demos improved confidence in beamforming control.
- Swarm autonomy: resource-aware scheduling continued to professionalize.
- PV and storage/control: steady, compounding improvements.

## Weighted Belief Shift (-2..+2)
| Tag | Delta | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| META | +1.5 | Control + uncertainty-aware design trending toward deployable engineering. |
| SBSP | +1.0 | Tracking/beam-control demos inch toward operational maturity. |
| SWARM | +1.0 | Resource-aware autonomy keeps getting more real. |
| CTRL | +0.5 | Harvesting/power-interface ecosystem stays strong. |
| PV | +0.5 | Reliability/manufacturing optimization via AI continues improving. |
| STOR | +0.2 | Steady progress without a January breakout. |

## Suggested Quest Outputs
1. **QST-0101: Metasurface Control Stack (Network Perspective)**
   - Tags: [META][CTRL][SWARM]
   - Deliverable: 1-page control spec (inputs, outputs, latency, failure modes).
2. **QST-0102: UQ Harness for Inverse-Designed Photonics**
   - Tags: [META][MFG][MAT]
   - Deliverable: tolerance sweeps, drift models, and a trust-score checklist.
3. **QST-0103: Q1 2026 Power-Chain Sim v0**
   - Tags: [PV][STOR][SBSP][SWARM]
   - Deliverable: relay-chain sim with metasurface gain modeled as loss reduction.
4. **QST-0104: Beam Tracking Abstraction**
   - Tags: [SBSP][CTRL]
   - Deliverable: moving-target link model (tracking error → coupling loss → safety cutoff).
5. **QST-0105: Energy-Aware Swarm Policy**
   - Tags: [SWARM][CTRL]
   - Deliverable: SNS-specific policy for relay/store/quiet decisions.

## SNS Awareness Update
- Physics-limited: near-sun thermal/radiation remains the boss-level constraint.
- Engineering-limited: metasurface controllability + validation are improving.
- Funding-limited: interplanetary beaming remains hard to fund; a harsh-constraints tile demo is fundable.
