## Hypothesis
If SNS defines a one-page night-side energy budget target with explicit storage assumptions, then storage pathway evaluation can be compared on consistent mission-level requirements.

## Method
- Inputs: `calendar/roundups/2026-02-08.md`, SNS power-chain assumptions, public storage performance ranges.
- Procedure: Specify target demand profile, reserve margin, and charge/discharge constraints; map plausible storage paths.
- Metrics: Budget table complete; at least three storage pathways scored against target.

## Success Criteria
- Must: Includes demand, duration, round-trip efficiency assumptions, and margin policy.
- Nice-to-have: Includes sensitivity rows for degradation and thermal derating.

## Artifacts
- docs/night_side_energy_budget_target.md

## Risks
- Uncertain duty cycles can dominate error bars and mis-rank storage options.

## Next Step
Draft one-page budget template and fill baseline assumptions from existing SNS docs.
