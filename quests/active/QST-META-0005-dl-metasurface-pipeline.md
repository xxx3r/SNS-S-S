## Hypothesis
If we curate a targeted reading list and pipeline map for DL-assisted metasurface design, then we can distinguish simulation-first tasks that are bench-feasible in 2026 from speculative hardware leaps.

## Method
- Inputs: `calendar/roundups/2026-02-08.md`, recent metasurface inverse-design literature, SNS constraints.
- Procedure: Build reading list + pipeline diagram (data, model, validation, fabrication handoff) with feasibility labels.
- Metrics: Reading list delivered; each pipeline stage tagged as "sim now", "bench now", or "later".

## Success Criteria
- Must: At least 8 curated references and a clear feasibility rubric for 2026.
- Nice-to-have: Includes a small benchmark task with public datasets/tools.

## Artifacts
- docs/metasurface_dl_pipeline_2026.md

## Risks
- Literature recency bias may underweight practical fabrication bottlenecks.

## Next Step
Assemble an initial 8-paper list and assign feasibility tags.
