# QST-SIM-0003: GEO Ring Power-Chain Model

Status: Active, baseline implemented  
Priority: P1  
Tags: [SIM, GEO, SBSP, POWER]

## Hypothesis

Role-specialized nodes around an idealized GEO ring can maintain field coverage and intermittent host delivery through eclipse windows more effectively than identical independent nodes.

## Current baseline

`GEORingWorld` provides orbital phase, eclipse windows, thermal proxy, and coverage bins.

## Remaining method

- Add receiver / line-of-sight windows.
- Compare role mixes and storage-node fractions.
- Sweep eclipse fraction and beam efficiency.

## Success criteria

- Energy, survival, curtailment, and coverage plots.
- Baseline versus coordinated comparison.
- Explicit conditions under which relay losses erase benefit.

## Artifacts

- `outputs/qst_sim_0003/`
- `docs/system/geo_ring_assumptions.md`

## Falsifier

If the host receives less useful energy after relay costs across plausible efficiencies, power relaying should remain secondary to sensing and diagnostics.
