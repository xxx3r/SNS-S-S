## Hypothesis
If SNS documentation includes a concise requirements crib sheet aligned to DARPA POWER-style demo priorities, then prototype planning will better reflect safety, pointing, and measurable link-budget outcomes.

## Method
- Inputs: `calendar/roundups/2026-02-08.md`, public DARPA POWER summaries, SNS quest assumptions.
- Procedure: Produce a one-page checklist covering relay safety constraints, pointing tolerance, link budget fields, and demo metrics.
- Metrics: Checklist completed and referenced by at least one active technical quest.

## Success Criteria
- Must: Includes explicit sections for safety guardrails, pointing verification, and end-to-end accounting.
- Nice-to-have: Includes pass/fail gates for tabletop vs field demos.

## Artifacts
- docs/darpa_power_requirements_crib_sheet.md

## Risks
- Public-source interpretation may diverge from official program requirements.

## Next Step
Draft checklist skeleton and capture missing data fields as TODOs.
