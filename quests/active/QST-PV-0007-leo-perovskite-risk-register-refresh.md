## Hypothesis
If SNS captures a concise LEO perovskite constraint taxonomy as a risk register, then PV pathway decisions can use explicit gate criteria before scaling from macro deployables to smaller SNS node surfaces.

## Method
- Inputs: `calendar/roundups/2026-02-15.md`, prior SNS PV assumptions, publicly stated LEO PV degradation concerns.
- Procedure: Build a one-page risk register with severity/likelihood/gate fields and map each risk to required proof artifacts.
- Metrics: Register includes at least 8 risks and each risk has a validation gate.

## Success Criteria
- Must: Includes radiation, thermal cycling, vacuum effects, encapsulation, manufacturing variability, and deployment survivability risks.
- Nice-to-have: Includes separate gates for "tabletop", "subscale in-space", and "mission-ready".

## Artifacts
- docs/pv_leo_perovskite_risk_register.md

## Risks
- Public information may under-specify private test conditions and overstate readiness.

## Next Step
Draft the risk table skeleton and pre-fill mandatory gate columns from the 2026-02-15 roundup constraints.
