Current Quest: QST-0004
Current Step: Interpret fixed-total-PV comparison output and capture tradeoff takeaway.

Last Output Artifact:
- outputs/latest/pv_area_vs_swarm_size/pv_area_vs_swarm_size.csv
- outputs/latest/pv_area_vs_swarm_size/plots/PLOT_WARNING.txt
- experiments/compare_pv_area_vs_swarm_size.py

Blockers / Known Bugs:
- `matplotlib` is not installed in this environment, so plot output is recorded as `PLOT_WARNING.txt`.

Aurora Score (last session): A = 0.7 ∠ -75°

Next Move (one shot):
- Add a concise interpretation note to QST-0004 from the generated comparison table.
